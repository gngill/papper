I created this project because some Dreamstation 2's do not use a SD Card and due to the fact that the encyrption was causing issues with OSCAR.

This Firefox Plugin Scrapes Data from: mydreammapper.com/Home/Sleep and allows you to paste it into a spreadsheet.

It is currently finding and copying the following fields:

Date
AHI
Total Clear Airway Apneas
Total Obstructive Apneas
Total Hypopneas
Usage

How do use:
1. Make sure you have the Dreamstation App on your phone
2. Make sure your DS2 is connected to your phone via Bluetooth and syncing regularly
3. Sign-In to mydreammapper.com/Home/Sleep
4. Go Day By Day and Hit the 'PAP' Plugin Icon
5. Paste Data into Spreadsheet
