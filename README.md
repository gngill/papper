I created this project because some Dreamstation 2's do not use a SD Card and due to the fact that the encyrption was causing issues with OSCAR.

This Firefox Plugin Scrapes Data from: mydreammapper.com/Home/Sleep and allows you to paste it into a spreadsheet.

It is currently finding and copying the following fields:

  1. Date
  2. AHI
  3. Total Clear Airway Apneas
  4. Total Obstructive Apneas
  5. Total Hypopneas
  6. Usage

How do use:

  1. Make sure you have the Dreamstation App on your phone
  2. Make sure your DS2 is connected to your phone via Bluetooth and syncing regularly
  3. Sign-In to mydreammapper.com/Home/Sleep
  4. Go Day By Day and Hit the 'PAP' Plugin Icon
  5. Paste Data into Spreadsheet


This is currently under development and I am running it as a Temporary Add-On. It can be packaged and made permanent as is.

You can load the extension temporarily to test it before packaging it permanently:

1. Open Firefox.
2. In the address bar, type about:debugging and hit Enter.
3. Click on “This Firefox” in the sidebar.
4. Click the “Load Temporary Add-on…” button.
5. Load manifest.json
